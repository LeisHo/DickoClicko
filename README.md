# Dicko Clicko — an interactive rope-physics toy

A single-page HTML/canvas toy: a circle hangs a rope you can punch, hold to
grow, or double-click to cut. Cut pieces fall with real physics and (if a
floor is enabled) pile up naturally. Built to work on both desktop and
mobile browsers.

See `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` for the current state (objective, scope,
current state, recent decisions, known limitations, next action — the part
that changes often) and `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` for what's being worked
on right now. This README stays a short pointer, not a duplicate of either —
don't let real content drift into this file instead of those.

## How to run it

No build step for the app itself — `index.html` is the entire app. Open it
directly in a browser, or serve the folder with any static file server.
(The one exception is `api/save-settings.js`, a Vercel serverless
function — see "Dev panel settings sync" below; it only runs when this
project is deployed on Vercel, and needs no build step of its own either.)

**Dev mode** (shows the tuning panel) is on automatically when:
- opened via `file://`, or the hostname is `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`, **or**
- the URL has `?dev=1` appended.

Otherwise the panel is hidden and only the animation renders.

### Dev panel settings sync (one-time Vercel setup)

Save Settings/Reset try 3 tiers in order (see the big comment above
`saveSettings()`/`resetSettings()` in `index.html` for the full picture):
1. **This Vercel API** (`api/save-settings.js`) — works from any device,
   including a phone with no filesystem access of its own. **Requires the
   one-time setup below before it does anything.**
2. **File System Access API** — a native save-file picker, direct local
   disk write. Desktop Chromium only, and only meaningful against a real
   local checkout (not a random visitor's disk on the deployed site).
3. **Local save prompt + this tab's own session cache** — last resort when
   opened as a bare local file with no server at all, or neither tier
   above is available.

Until the two env vars below are set on the Vercel project, tier 1 does
nothing (Save silently falls through to tier 2 or 3 instead) — that's
expected until this is set up, not a sign of a bug:

1. **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** — a GitHub fine-grained personal access token,
   scoped to only this repo (`LeisHo/DickoClicko`), with **Contents: Read
   and write** permission and nothing else. Create one at
   github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens →
   Fine-grained tokens.
2. **`DEV_PANEL_SAVE_SECRET`** — an anti-abuse shared token (not a real
   secret — it also lives in the page's own client-side source, same as
   any other value there). Set it to `PkrbMti03M6xm3FEThYXa8gGW_08BOGj`
   (the value already embedded in `index.html`'s `DEV_PANEL_SAVE_SECRET`
   constant — the same value CLICKO's own Vercel project uses, since this
   is one workspace-wide shared token, not a per-project one) — or change
   both to a new value together if you'd rather generate your own.

Add both under the Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables,
then redeploy. `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_BRANCH`, and `SETTINGS_FILE_PATH`
are optional overrides (see `api/save-settings.js`) — the defaults
already match this repo.

## Project structure

```
DICKOCLICKO/
├── index.html               <the entire app — markup, styles, and JS inline>
├── api/                     <save-settings.js — Vercel serverless function, see above>
├── docs/                    <README (pointer only — this file), PROJECT_SUMMARY.md,
│                             CODE_SUMMARY.md, PROJECT_PROGRESS.md, CHANGELOG.txt>
├── data/                    <processed/dev-panel-settings.json — the git-tracked
│                             settings log Save Settings writes to>
├── datalog/, config/, models/, deliverable/, logs/, results/,
│   scripts/, src/, tests/    <unused for this project — see CLAUDE.md>
```

This is otherwise a single-file project (see project `CLAUDE.md` for why)
— `api/` is the one small, necessary exception (a Vercel serverless
function can't live inside `index.html`); the rest of the skeleton
folders above are the workspace-standard scaffold and mostly stay empty
for this project.

## Known limitations

See `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`'s Known Limitations section for the current,
maintained list — not duplicated here to avoid drift between two copies of
the same information.

## Roadmap

No formal roadmap is tracked separately. See `docs/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` for
what's currently being worked on and what's next, and `docs/CHANGELOG.txt`
for the full history of what's been built.
